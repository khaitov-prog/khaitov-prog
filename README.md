### Hey!

I'm a fresh developer looking to enter the workforce soon. I've spent about 3 years at Sheridan College learning as much as I could about various aspects of development, IT, administration and more.

Because of the breadth of knowledge I gained from my time at Sheridan, I believe I could comfortably work as a Full-Stack Dev.

I'm currently learning about Cloud Computing (Azure/AWS) to further modernise the web applications that I build.

You can either reach me by my email @ farrukh.kh98@gmail.com or my linkedin @ linkedin.com/in/khaitov/
